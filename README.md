# Cittadella/UX Bulletin Board System

Cittadella/UX is a highly configurable Bulletin Board System (BBS).
It is an interactive multi-user system featuring Message Boards (organized
in rooms and floors), with a Local Mailbox for each user, quick comunication
tools (Express Messages, Chat Rooms), user management and logging facilities.

The package comes with a monolythic server (the cittaserver) which listens
for new connections, processes the client requests and provvides all the BBS
services. Two versions of the client application (cittaclient) come along: the
remote client, running on the same host of the server, allowing for telnet
connections, and the local client, running on the user's machine.

It is an Italian language BBS, but we plan to add multilanguage support in
the future.

Cittadella/UX is released under GNU's General Public Licence (GPL).
